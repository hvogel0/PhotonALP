Propagation of photons and ALPs through the Milky Way

I. Directories
---------------------

Chi		Photon-photon dispersion using the model by Vernetto
Gamma		Absorption files following the model by Vernetto
Data		Contains the data computed with the script

II. Files
---------------------

main.py			Main file to start integration. Arguments are [latitude b in degrees (galactic coordinates), longitude l in degrees (galactic coordinates)]
mw_parameters.py	Contains the details of the Milky Way models
propagation.py		Contains the functions to propagate the photon-ALP system
testing.py		Script to test implementation
