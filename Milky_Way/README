Propagation of photons and ALPs through the Milky Way

I. Directories
---------------------

Chi		Photon-photon dispersion using the model by Vernetto
Gamma		Absorption files following the model by Vernetto
Data		Contains the data computed with the script

II. Files
---------------------

main.py			Main file to start integration. Arguments are latitude b in degrees (galactic coordinates), longitude l in degrees (galactic coordinates), mode ('ALP' or 'None') which sets the initial condition to either [0,0,1] or [0,0,0], and source_flag ('True' or 'False') which activates photon production through CR-proton collisions.
mw_parameters.py	Contains the details of the Milky Way models
propagation.py		Contains the functions to propagate the photon-ALP system
testing.py		Script to test implementation
