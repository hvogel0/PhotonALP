The files in this directory contain the photon-photon dispersion with the following structure

Energy [eV]\t	Distance [kpc]\t	\Delta_{\gamma\gamma} [kpc-1]

The distance is chosen such that the dispersion is in the middle of the corresponding distance bin.
A linear interpolation should give the correct result.

The naming is such that the first number indicates the latitude and the second number indicates the longitude.
