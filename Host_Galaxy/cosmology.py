"""
Defines cosmological parameters that are used for flux.py to convert the conversion probabilities into fluxes observed at earth.

Parameters
Omega_lambda		fraction of energy density in cosmological constant
Omega_M			fraction of energy density in matter
H0			Hubble expansion parameter from PLANCK in s-1
