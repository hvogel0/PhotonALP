Computation of axion flux from extragalactic sources.

I. Files
------------------
main.py			Main script that integrates photon-ALP system. Call with ./main.py B[muG] gag[10^-11 GeV] mass[log10[neV]]
flux.py			Converts output of main.py into fluxes at the Milky Way. Call with ./flux.py B[muG] gag[10-11 GeV] mass[log10[neV]] flux_model . Here flux_model can either be Kopper or Nieder depending on the IceCube result one wants to match
evolution.py		Contains functions that are integrated by main.py
cosmology.py		Defines Cosmological parameters used by flux.py
neutrino_models.py	Defines neutrino model that flux.py is matched against

II. Folder
------------------
Galaxy_Models	Contains files that determine the environment of the host galaxies
Data		Contains results from main.py
Flux		Contains fluxes that are created by flux.py
Log		Folder for log files produced by main.py

TODO: Implement Schober evolution model
